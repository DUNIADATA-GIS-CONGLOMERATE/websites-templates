Step 1: Set Up a React Project
If you haven't already, the easiest way to start is by creating a new React project. You can do this with either Vite or Create React App.

Using Vite (Recommended)
Open your terminal and run the following command. This will set up a new project named my-geostudio-app and guide you through a few quick steps.

Bash

**npm create vite@latest my-geostudio-app -- --template react**
Using Create React App
While a bit older, this also works well.

Bash

**npx create-react-app my-geostudio-app**
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Your new React app will need to install the following libraries to support the code I provided:

Framer Motion: For animations.

Lucide React: For the icons.

Tailwind CSS: For all the styling.

Navigate into your new project's directory and run these commands:

Bash

**cd my-geostudio-app**
**npm install framer-motion lucide-react**
Step 3: Integrate the Code
**Replace App.jsx**: Go into the src folder of your project and replace the contents of the App.jsx file with the full code I provided.

Add Tailwind CDN: Since Tailwind is not configured in this app, you need to add the CDN link directly. Open your index.html file (located in the root of your project) and add this line inside the <head> tag:

HTML

**<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>**
Step 4: Run the Application
Now you can start your development server to see the website. In your terminal, make sure you are in the project's root directory and run:

Bash

npm run dev
This will give you a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) that you can open in your browser to see the live website.
